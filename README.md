# Project Showcase

This repository contains a collection of various programming projects which I implemented in different languages.

## Project Categories

Projects are organized into the following categories:

- C/C++ (`c-cpp`)
- PHP (`php`)
- Python (`python`)
- Web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) (`web`)

### C/C++ (`c-cpp`)

- **counter.c**: A command-line utility that reads text from standard input and counts the occurrences of digits, whitespace characters (spaces, newlines, tabs), and all other characters. It then prints the counts.
- **histogram.c**: This program takes a paragraph of text as input and outputs each word from the paragraph followed by its length (number of characters). For example, 'hello=5 world=5'.
- **reverse.c**: A simple utility that reads a line of text from standard input and prints the reversed version of that string.

### PHP (`php`)

- **csv-reader**: A web application that reads transaction data from CSV files. It processes these files to calculate and display financial summaries, such as total income, expenses, and net balance.
- **gas-inventory-system**: A web-based inventory management system for gas cylinders. It tracks stock levels of different cylinder sizes (e.g., 2KG, 12.5KG), manages customer information, and records cylinder checkouts and returns.
- **laravel-api**: An example web API built using the Laravel PHP framework.
- **library-system**: A web application for managing a library's collection and members. It allows for tracking books (by title, author, genre), managing library members (including admin users), and handling book checkouts and returns with due dates.

### Python (`python`)

- **files-project**: A script that processes student data from a CSV file (`data.txt`). It can group student records by subject, name, or class. Additionally, it calculates total marks, generates rankings, and identifies top performers in each subject, optionally writing these results to text files.
- **image-downloader**: A utility that downloads a batch of images. It uses multiprocessing to speed up the download process by fetching multiple images concurrently and reports on the success/failure rate.
- **scraping**: A web scraper that extracts book information (name, price, stock status, rating) from the website `https://books.toscrape.com`. It uses multithreading to scrape data from multiple pages simultaneously and saves the aggregated data into a `data.json` file.
- **wallpaper-project**: A script that sets the desktop wallpaper based on the current weather of a user-specified city. It fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap, finds a corresponding image on Unsplash, and updates the desktop background. (Note: Relies on Windows-specific functionality for setting the wallpaper.)

### Web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) (`web`)

- **box-shadow-generator**: An interactive web tool for generating CSS `box-shadow` styles. Users can adjust various parameters (offsets, blur, spread, color, opacity, inset) and get the corresponding CSS code.
- **calculator-for-banking**: A webpage featuring financial calculators, specifically for 'Interest on Interest' (compound interest) and 'Declining Balance' loan calculations. It's styled with Bootstrap.
- **grocery-items-manager**: A simple web application to help manage a grocery budget. Users can set a budget, add items with price and quantity, and the app tracks the remaining budget.
- **my-profile**: A static personal profile page built with HTML and CSS, displaying basic information like bio, age, ambition, and social media links.
- **portfolio**: A personal portfolio website for a frontend developer. It showcases skills, projects (with live demos), an about section, and a contact form. It's designed to be responsive.
- **react-render**: A basic JavaScript project demonstrating a simplified custom implementation of a React-like rendering process. It takes a JavaScript object representing a virtual DOM and converts it into HTML to display on the page.
